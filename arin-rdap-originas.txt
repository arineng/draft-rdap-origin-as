1.  Introduction

   Since 2007, The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) has
   accepted a list of Autonomous System (AS) numbers as an attribute of
   network objects when they are registered.  The intent of these AS
   numbers is to signify an AS originating a route for the network.
   This document specifies an extension to express this information in
   RDAP [4] network objects and a method to query RDAP network objects
   registered with these AS numbers.

2.  RDAP Extension Identifier

   This document uses the RDAP extension identifier "arin_originas0" in
   accordance with Section 5 of RFC 7482 [3] and Section 2.1 of RFC 7483
   [4].  The registration for the identifier can be found in Section 5
   in accordance with Section 8.1 of RFC 7480 [2].

3.  Networks By Origin AS Query

   While RDAP has defined queries to retreive networks and autonomous
   system numbers by their identifiers, the base RDAP specification does

   not contain a query to retreive a set of network objects for which an
   AS number has been associated as an origination in network routing.

   This extension defines a query to retreive a set of network objects
   given an AS number, where the AS number has been registered as
   originating a route (i.e. origin AS).  This query has the following
   syntax:

   arin_originas0_networksbyoriginas/<autonomous system number>

   An example would be:

   https://rdap.arin.net/registry/
   arin_originas0_networksbyoriginas/65538

   The expected result from the query is defined in Section 4.

4.  Networks and Orgin AS Information in RDAP

   This extension defines two new JSON data structures for RDAP.  The
   first is an array of networks (similar to the arrays found in
   Section 8 of RFC 7483 [4], and the second is an array of origin AS
   numbers to be placed in network objects.

     The formal syntax specified in JSON Content Rules (JCR) [5] using
                     rules from RDAP JCR [6] follows.

#{ import
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arineng/draft-rdap-jcr/master/jcr/rdap_all.jcr
as rdap_base }

$networkSearchResults = "arin_originas0_networkSearchResults" : [
    $rdap_base.network_oc *
]

$origin_autnums = "arin_originas0_originautnums" : [ integer * ]

                      Figure 1: Formal Syntax in JCR

4.1.  Network Search Results

   The set of networks returned by the query in Section 3 is represented
   by an array named "arin_originas0_networkSearchResults".  Each item
   of the array is to be an IP network as defined by Section 5.4 of RFC
   7483 [4].

   The formal syntax definition is $networkSearchResults in Figure 1.

4.2.  Origin AS Numbers

   Each IP network defined in Section 5.4 of RFC 7483 [4] may contain an
   array named "arin_originas0_originautnums".  This array contains
   number reprensenting an Autonomous System (AS).  The array may be
   empty, but if allowed by policy should always be present in both the
   result of query specified in Section 3 and any other RDAP query where
   an IP network object is given.

   The formal syntax definition is $origin_autnums in Figure 1.

4.3.  Example Result

        The following is an elided example of a query returning an
               "arin_originas0_networkSearchResults" result.

        {
          "rdapConformance" : [ "rdap_level_0", "arin_originas0" ],
          "arin_originas0_networkSearchResults" : [
            {
              "objectClassName" : "ip network",
              "handle" : "XXXX-2",
              "startAddress" : "2001:db8::",
              "endAddress" : "2001:db8:0::ffff",
              "ipVersion" : "v6",
              "arin_originas0_originautnums" : [
                12,
                65538
              ],
              ...
            },
             ...

          ]
        }
