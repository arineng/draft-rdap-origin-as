This git repository describes ARIN's RDAP extension for querying IP networks
by an origin AS number.

The source of the specification is in [arin-rdap-originas.xml](arin-rdap-originas.xml) in
xml2rfc format. That is used to build the [html](arin-rdap-originas.html) and [text](arin-rdap-originas.txt)
versions.

A [markdown](arin-rdap-originas.md) is created using the Ruby gem `reverse_markdown`.
